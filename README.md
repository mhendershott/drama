**Adventure Mode**

This is a bit of sillyness I dreamed up while playing with UI builder in ServiceNow.
The intent of this is to demonstrate that while workspaces are where you may see UI builder the most, there is much more to UI builder than just workspaces.
I encourage people to start building from scratch and imagining new ways to present data. 

I may add more to it over time, and if you are so inclined, I encourage you to do the same and share your ideas with the community.
Create a fork and get creative!
